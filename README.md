This is the code repository for **Ubuntu Insights**, a user transparent, open, platform-agnostic and cross application solution for reporting hardware information and other collected metrics.

Ubuntu Insight is designed to show you exactly what is being sent, and allow you to acknowledge and control your own data. The code in this repository is designed to mainly be invoked by a controlling application, but a command line tool is also provided.

This is designed to be a full replacement for Ubuntu Report. 

## Troubleshooting

TODO: Add details on how to debug this project, where to increase verbosity, how to find logs, how to run in debug mode.
